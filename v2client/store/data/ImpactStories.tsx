        “When I see a white piece of paper, I feel I’ve got to draw. And
        drawing, for me, is the beginning of everything” - Ellsworth Kelly{" "}
        <br />
        <br /> ‘I love to draw’ says Pratheeksha; a 12-year-old girl who always
        loves to read books and draw. She tells us that it keeps her happy and
        engaged in spite of her ongoing treatment and a long recovery period
        ahead of her. Pratheeksha is diagnosed with left distal femur
        osteosarcoma (a type of bone cancer) which required 4 cycles of
        chemotherapy, surgery followed by another 6 cycles of chemotherapy. She
        has received 4 cycles of chemotherapy and recently underwent surgery.
        Currently, she is receiving her 4th cycle of chemotherapy. MSMF
        sponsored her surgery and is continuing to support her treatment by
        sponsoring her medicines and tests. Pratheeksha is a single child and
        her father is a tailor by profession and her mother is a housewife. The
        family hails from the Kodanga region of Karnataka. “My daughter is my
        everything. I can’t imagine what my daughter had to go through all these
        months. By God’s grace, MSMF came forward to help my daughter’s surgery
        which was a success. My daughter is now recovering well and getting her
        regular follow-up with the last few chemotherapies. We can’t wait to get
        home and live our lives again. MSMF support was a timely help which
        saved my daughter’s life and I’ll forever be grateful and thankful for
        their help”.

        “My son was first diagnosed with Pre B Cell ALL in 2019. We were all sad
        to hear his condition. We spent a lot of money and got him treated. He
        was recovering well, when we came for a follow up and found that he got
        relapsed again. We felt like our whole world came crashing down. Our
        only son has to go through this again. We were running low on funds as
        he had a lot of complications due to the treatments and did not know how
        to afford for both his regular treatments and others. With the help of
        the doctors, we received funds from MSMF for Vinol’s BMT and tests. MSMF
        was a God sent angel to help us at the time of our most desperate need.
        Now we are back in our home town in Udupi and my son is recovering well.
        He is currently studying in 7th grade”. Vinol John Saldanha is a 13 year
        old boy from Udupi. He was first diagnosed with Pre B Cell Acute
        lymphoblastic leukemia in December, 2019 and got treated for the same.
        He got relapsed in February 2021 with the same condition. Chemotherapy
        and BMT was the treatment suggested by the doctors. The family had a lot
        of financial problems to pay for the complete treatment. Hence, MSMF
        sponsored partially for his BMT and Chemo port removal, medicines and
        tests. Vinol is an only child and his father is a driver by profession
        and mother is a housewife.

      <p>
        When we first met he was playing with a ball unaware of his condition
        and all the treatments he has to undergo. A lively child who loves to
        dance and run around the block was diagnosed with &#39;Acute
        Lymphoblastic Leukemia&#39;. Though the intent of the treatment is
        curative and he has a good 5-year survival percentage, upon hearing
        his condition the family was devastated. Both his parents are uneducated
        and did not have any awareness about the disease or its treatment
        process.  Dhanush&#39;s father is a daily wage laborer in a construction
        site who helps carry construction materials and his mother is a
        homemaker. He also has an elder sibling who is 5 years old.  He began
        his treatment in the month of February with a cost estimation of Rs. 12
        Lakhs to Rs. 14 Lakhs for Chemotherapy and Supportive care. Due to their
        family&#39;s situation, at the beginning itself, they found it very
        difficult to pay for his treatment and medicines. They have exhausted
        all their life savings and are now unable to continue treatment without
        any financial support. At present, the child is getting help from MSMF
        for Chemotherapy, however, we need support from generous donors like you
        to raise Rs.12 lakhs which is required to complete the treatment and
        give Dhanush the life that he deserves.   We request your support in our
        campaign ‘Help for Danush’ and make a difference in his life.

    about: (
      <p>
        My name is Manimegalai and I’m 24years old. I’m married and have two
        children; my daughter&#39;s name is Iniya Sri who is 3 years old and my
        son’s name is Kavinth and he is 2 years old. My husband Kumar is a Lab
        Technician and earns Rs 25,000 per month and he is the only breadwinner
        of the family. Everything changed in December 2020 when we heard that my
        daughter Iniya has been diagnosed with ‘Acute lymphoblastic leukemia’.
        All our dreams came crashing down and we never imagined a day like this
        would ever come in our lives. We did not know what it was and had no
        idea how we were going to afford treatment for her. Doctors advised 6
        cycles of chemotherapy to be given immediately and we sought help from
        many people and started her treatment but it was not enough. We sold all
        the assets we had and it was still not enough. A day did not go by
        thinking how we were going to afford her treatment and was just hoping
        for a miracle. We came across MSMF through the doctor who was treating
        our child and he suggested that we could seek help. Once we started
        getting help from MSMF, our burden was greatly reduced and we felt that
        we have got our daughter back. No words can express the kind of relief
        we experienced when we were told that MSMF had extended their help for
        Chemotherapy and follow-up. There were times I did not have any money to
        buy medicines and have cried not knowing what to do. After MSMF started
        to help, we got medicines at a lower cost with an oncology drug
        discount. “MSMF was a God sent angel to me at the right time to help my
        daughter’s treatment and I’ll forever be grateful and thankful for the
        help”.
