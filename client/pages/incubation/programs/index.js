        description={`There is a widening gap between the healthcare needs and medical technologies evolution, more so in India where majority of hospitals depend on imported technologies. There is an urgent need to integrate the clinical and molecular worlds to bridge this gap. The real science translation to the needs of Indian patients will have to happen in India and this can only be enabled in an ecosystem where there is constant interaction between clinicians and molecular scientists. The technologies cannot be developed only by the clinicians as they are already overburdened with patient care, diagnostics etc and molecular scientists are not aware of clinical needs to the extent that they need to be or have no access to a facility where the technologies which can help in healthcare evaluated in a clinical set up. Our facility can integrate of these two making Integrative Translational Research happen along with access to pre-seed or proof of concept funds.

MSMF-Narayana Health have been at the forefront in successful implementation of affordable healthcare in our country and this vision when expanded to technology development and translational research will enable greater value for improved healthcare outcomes. Development of Mazumdar Shaw Medical Foundation and Translational Institute has resulted in the TBI under the aegis of Department of Science & Technology in July 2015 within the campus and several companies incubated so far. The major advantage for these companies is that they have direct access to clinicians for interactions for real time productization of ideas with proper clinical evidence. Along with this, Narayana Health has set up a clinical research department which has gained all necessary national and international clearances to perform clinical trials (USFDA), which acts as a conduit between the incubator and the hospital infrastructure.

This infrastructure has been set up with a vision to perform molecular research and enable high quality scientists to develop their ideas into value for clinical biomarkers. In order to do this, MSMF has several important facilities for molecular and translational research. The facilities include genomics, proteomics, cell biology, immunology, histopathology, transcriptomics, animal house, bioinformatics and biostatistics. The entrepreneurs who can get incubated will have access to world-class infrastructure along with clinical support and funds in developing validated technologies`}

Bill Clinton gave the green light to the U.S. military to stop intentionally scrambling satellite signals, thus paving the way for civilians to use GPS with the same accuracy as the military had long enjoyed. All of the consumer internement underway to make various elements of scientific research more open and collaborative in order to disrupt and impact mankind.

            Over the decade MSMF & Narayana Health has put in several forms of
            infrastructure to promote healthcare innovation and
            entrepreneurship. The Narayana Health City located in Bommasandra,
            Bangalore houses the Mazumdar Shaw Medical Foundation and the
            Translational Research wing each formed to serve translational
            research unit in healthcare. In this infrastructure to promote
            healthcare innovation in 2014 the Department of Science and
            Technology – Government of India conferred upon Mazumdar Shaw
            Medical Foundation the status of the Technology Business Incubator
            too. All of these milestones have created a unique innovation layer
            to the DNA of the organisation. The BIONEST proposal is a move to
            bring all the initiatives under one umbrella and leap-frog to form
            and create a larger impact potential in the entire ecosystem in
            healthcare technology.
            <br /> From Villgro standpoint, the goal of nurturing impact driven
            enterprises begun in 2001 and since then has formed multiple
            initiatives to promote the same. Villgro has worked enormously
            specifically to look at healthcare impact for the bottom of the
            pyramid and how to identify and nurture technologies that also
            address the BoP section of the society. Under the research hospital
            framework of BIONEST, both the institutions wish to combine their
            strengths and form a unique infrastructure meant to focus on the
            clinical validation and fast-tracking the path to commercialisation
            in the impact sector. The innovations developed and nurtured at this
            incubator can have a significant social impact on the marginalized
            communities in India. The people at the bottom of the pyramid
            require access to economical solutions to address their increasing
            and complex healthcare challenges. The incubatees of Bionest strive
            to create scalable, profitable, and sustainable enterprises which
            will provide high quality and low-cost medical care.
