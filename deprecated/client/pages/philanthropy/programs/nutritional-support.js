        "Nutrition plays a great role in a personâ€™s daily life and it is essential for a healthy living; particularly for patients undergoing cancer treatment. Most of the patients who come for treatment are from below poverty line and underprivileged families who cannot afford a well-balanced nutritional diet as they struggle to make ends meet. MSMF supports such patients during their chemotherapy sessions by providing them with a healthy balanced diet (bananas, almonds and threptin diskettes). We regularly provide support for around 800 patients every month and we continue to do so until the completion of their treatment."
